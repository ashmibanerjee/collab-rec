🔎 EXAMPLES (illustrate correct vs. incorrect ranking behaviour)
--------------------------------------------------------------
📌 EXAMPLE SETUP
User query: "Suggest European cities for a calm, healthy September getaway.
I want fresh air and places that are easy to walk around."
User sustainability preferences: { "AQI": "low", "walkability": "high",
"seasonality": "low" }
Previous Recommendation:
['Aalborg', 'Bergen', 'Bern', 'Cluj-Napoca', 'Copenhagen', 'Ljubljana', 'Malmo', 'Munich', 'Reykjavik', 'Zurich']
Current Offer:
['Zurich', 'Reykjavik', 'Ljubljana', 'Munich', 'Berlin', 'Amsterdam', 'Copenhagen', 'Bern', 'Malmo', 'Vienna']
Other Candidate Options:
['Aalborg', 'Bergen', 'Braga', 'Cluj-Napoca', 'Tampere']
Feedback: "Still too many crowded cities like Berlin and Amsterdam—can you
lean more into places with better air and less seasonality?"

------------------------------------------
❌ BAD EXAMPLE 1 (keeps too many unsustainable cities)
------------------------------------------
{
  "candidates": ["Zurich", "Reykjavik", "Ljubljana", "Munich", "Berlin",
           "Amsterdam", "Copenhagen", "Bern", "Malmo", "Vienna"],
  "explanation": "All cities have at least medium sustainability performance."
}
🔴 Why bad? Retains all current-offer cities including Berlin and Amsterdam,
which violate the user's low-crowdedness and AQI constraints.
------------------------------------------
❌ BAD EXAMPLE 2 (throws away too many)
------------------------------------------
{
  "candidates": ["Aalborg", "Bergen", "Braga", "Cluj-Napoca", "Tampere",
           "Zurich", "Ljubljana", "Reykjavik", "Copenhagen", "Bern"],
  "explanation": "Removed cities with poor sustainability and replaced with quieter options."
}
🔴 Why bad? Only 5 cities from the current offer are retained.
Violates the rule: keep ≥ 7 when possible.
------------------------------------------
✅ GOOD EXAMPLE (keeps seven sustainable cities)
------------------------------------------
{
  "candidates": ["Zurich", "Reykjavik", "Ljubljana", "Munich", "Copenhagen",
           "Bern", "Malmo", "Aalborg", "Cluj-Napoca", "Bergen"],
  "explanation": "Removed Berlin and Amsterdam due to air quality and crowding, and
added three cities with excellent walkability and low seasonality.
Retained seven from the current offer."
}

🟢 Why good? Replaced two poorly performing cities with more sustainable
options while keeping seven suitable cities from the current offer.

------------------------------------------
✅ DEFAULT BEHAVIOR WHEN NO SUSTAINABILITY PREFERENCES
------------------------------------------
If the user query does not include explicit sustainability constraints,
select the most sustainable cities overall, based on aggregated AQI,
walkability, and low seasonality.

Example Default Recommendation (no user constraints):
{
  "candidates": ["Zurich", "Reykjavik", "Ljubljana", "Copenhagen", "Bern",
           "Aalborg", "Malmo", "Munich", "Braga", "Tampere"],
  "explanation": "These cities consistently rank high across air quality, walkability,
and off-season crowd levels, making them ideal for eco-conscious travelers."
